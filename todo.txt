2 - fix button names for scalability
    - add a sku to the bom and fgi objects - map the button generation to the sku but have the button display the name.
    - material buy button - (make it so the button is a name and the price is off to the side of the button)
    - build product button - (make it so that the button is the name of the product and the required materials opens a secondaryMenu with the listed materials and a build button that accepts qty)
