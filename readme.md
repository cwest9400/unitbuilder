# Item shop
This is MVP version

**Overview** - A personal project and first piece to a larger manufacturing simulator. 

In item shop you can, buy raw materials, build products with the raw materials, store the products in inventory and sell the products to generate cash.


## Near future
- [ ] display user/system messages on html page 
- [ ] refactor button names for scalability
- [ ] material buy button - (make it so the button is a name and the price is off to the side of the button)
- [ ] build product button - (make it so that the button is the name of the product and the required materials opens a secondaryMenu with the listed materials and a build button that accepts qty)



## Far Future

Right now it's just vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. 
- [ ] add sql database, so data can persist
